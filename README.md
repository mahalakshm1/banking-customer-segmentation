# banking-customer-segmentation
A data science project that segments banking customers into groups based on their behavior and spending patterns using clustering algorithms. Built with Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization.

Overview
- Uses unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)** for segmentation.  
- Involves data preprocessing,feature scaling and visualization.  
- Built using Python,pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.  
- Visualizes clusters to interpret different customer groups (e.g., high-value, moderate, low-value customers).

Output:
-Cluster visualizations showing customer segments
-Insights into customer spending and saving behavior
